How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It was a new way, but seemed to help me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   In the case of an error I could just go back and see what caused it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Pros are you can see differance. Cons with Google you cannot.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    perhaps becuase it was built for a coding envrioemnt.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log shows me the diffrent commits and git diff compares differances.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  It will help me understand where did the probelme start

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try doing the git log command
